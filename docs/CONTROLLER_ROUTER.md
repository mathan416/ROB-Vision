# Controller Router: get your controllers ready to play

Controller Router lets you choose which gamepad controls each player, and which systems use those choices. It also gives VirtualGlove and Buddy a shared home on your UNO Q.

Already happy with your controls? Keep your saved choices. You only need this guide when you want to change a player, choose a system, or troubleshoot a pad.

## Open Setup

1. In your browser, open your UNO Q's address, such as `http://your-uno-q.local/`.
2. Choose **Setup** on the Controller Router page.
3. Select your paired console under **Console connection**.

You will see **Players** first, then **Systems**. Each console keeps its own settings. If no console appears, choose **Pair console** in Controller Router Setup first.

## Choose who plays

Before assigning a gamepad, configure its buttons in EmulationStation, your console's game menu.

1. Exit any running game.
2. In Router **Setup > Players**, find your gamepad by name.
3. Choose **Player 1**, **Player 2**, **Player 3**, or **Player 4**. Choose **Unassigned** if you do not want that pad to join a Router player.
4. If VirtualGlove is installed, choose its gesture player under **VirtualGlove player**, or leave it **Unassigned**.
5. Choose **Save assignments**.
6. Launch a game to try the new choices.

Keep a physical gamepad assigned to **Player 1** for the usual menu and exit controls. Several pads can share one player; a pad can belong to only one player. Buddy stays on **Player 2** for Gyromite's red and blue gates.

A game must support additional players for Player 3 or Player 4 to do anything. Assigning four pads does not turn a two-player game into a four-player game.

## Choose which systems use Router

Want Router for NES but your normal controls for Mega Drive / Genesis? You can choose each system separately.

1. With the game closed, open **Setup > Systems**.
2. Under **Routing selection**, choose **Choose systems individually**.
3. For each listed system, choose one of the following options.
4. Choose **Save assignments**, then launch your next game.

| Choose | What happens in a game |
| --- | --- |
| **Controller Router** | The system uses the player assignments you saved in **Players**, with the buttons you configured in EmulationStation. |
| **My existing setup** | The system uses its normal controller setup. Router adds no player-routing changes for that game. |

**Buddy's games and VirtualGlove require Controller Router enabled for NES.** You can still choose **My existing setup** for NES when you want to use your own controls instead.

New Router setups start with **NES only**. Upgrades keep your choices. **All Libretro systems, including newly added systems** applies Router to every supported RetroArch system. In individual mode, a newly discovered system starts with **My existing setup**.

The list covers systems that offer supported RetroArch emulators. Separate emulators, such as a standalone Amiga emulator, keep their own controls. Your choice also stays saved if a system is temporarily unavailable.

## Check a gamepad

1. In Router Setup, choose **Test inputs**.
2. Press a direction or button on the pad during the next five seconds.
3. Read the result, then repeat for another pad if needed.

**No button presses detected** can simply mean you did not press anything during the test. Try again before changing settings.

| Status | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Connected | The pad is available. Try **Test inputs** to identify it. |
| Unavailable | Turn on or reconnect the saved pad. If you replaced it, configure and assign the new one. |
| Mapping refreshed or updated | Router found your newer EmulationStation button setup. Exit and relaunch the game to use it. |

**Reload** brings back the saved choices and discards unsaved edits. **Restore previous** restores the preceding saved setup. Exit the game before saving or restoring.

## Start a game or choose an app

Launch a registered game on your paired console. Router selects VirtualGlove or R.O.B. Vision automatically, so you do not need a browser open for the controller to join the game. Only that app supplies game input and display cues. When the game ends, the UNO Q returns to its neutral display.

To open an app yourself, visit the UNO Q address. With one app installed, it opens directly. With both installed, choose VirtualGlove or R.O.B. Vision. **Apps** in either app returns to the chooser; it appears only when both are installed. Finish a game before changing apps manually. Both apps stay available in the background.

After a reboot, the UNO Q waits for a game or your choice. You do not need to reinstall or pair again.

## Get back to your game

**My pad works in the game menu but not in the game.** Try another connected pad: yours may be assigned to Player 2. Exit the game, check **Players**, and use **Test inputs** to identify the pad you want on Player 1. Save and relaunch.

**A wireless pad went to sleep.** Wake it or reconnect it. Router keeps its player controllers connected and returns the pad to its saved player. If the Router service itself restarted, exit and relaunch the game once it is ready.

**My buttons changed after I remapped them.** Exit the game, confirm the new buttons in EmulationStation, and relaunch. Your player assignment stays saved.

**I cannot save.** Finish the running game first. If another page changed the settings, choose **Reload**, make your choices again, and save.

**The UNO Q is showing the wrong app.** Check that the game is registered in the right app and that the console is paired with this UNO Q. Exit the game before making changes.

## Check Buddy’s gates

1. Launch Gyromite in **Game A** and stop where a colored gate is visible.
2. In R.O.B. Vision **Setup**, choose **Lower Blue** or **Lower Red** for that gate.
3. Watch the game screen, then choose **Release Both**.

Your physical Player 1 pad controls Hector. Buddy’s Player 2 input controls the gates. Stack-Up uses game commands to move Buddy and the blocks; it has no gate buttons.

The **Controllers** button beside a paired console in R.O.B. Vision Setup opens that console’s assignment editor. For pieces and movement, see the [Game Manual](GAME_MANUAL.md). For connection problems, see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## One shared console connection

Pair once for the UNO Q and console. VirtualGlove and R.O.B. Vision receive their own private credentials automatically when installed on both devices. Installing the other app later adds its access without another pairing. No SSH username or password is required.

Finish the game before pairing, changing app access, or removing a connection. Each console connects to one UNO Q at a time. Connecting it to another requires a new console code and Matrix confirmation.

1. Open **Apps > Setup > Pair console**. Both product Setup pages have an **Open Pair console** link to this same page.
2. Open the secure address printed by the UNO Q installer, using its `.local` name or LAN IP. Pairing uses HTTPS port **8444**.
3. Before accepting the local certificate, compare the browser's SHA-256 fingerprint with the fingerprint printed by the UNO Q installer. During confirmation, its beginning also appears after **ID** on the Matrix. Stop if they differ.
4. Enter the console hostname or IP address and paste its complete **CR1 connection code**. The console installer prints this single-use code; it lasts five minutes.
5. Choose **Continue**, read the six Matrix digits after **PN**, and enter them within two minutes.
6. Choose **Connect**. Wait for **Connected** and check each app's readiness below it.
